Descriptive (what happened)

Coffee Beans - Arabica is the top-selling product in Kigali in Q1 2025 by total revenue.
Kigali showed month-over-month growth from Jan to Feb, then a change in March due to a premium product sale in March.
The top 25% customers in each region (NTILE = 1) account for a disproportionate share of revenue.

Diagnostic (why it happened)

Promotions, seasonal demand, or single large transactions (e.g., premium blend) can explain spikes.
Regions with fewer customers show larger volatility month-to-month.
High-spend customers likely represent frequent shoppers or corporate purchases.

Prescriptive (what to do next)

Prioritize high-revenue products for regional promotions and stock planning.
Investigate months with large deviations (promo, stockouts, pricing differences).
Create retention and cross-sell campaigns for the top quartile of customers.
